///////////////////////////////
//  6v6 GSPEC Binds a0.0.1  //
//      By AndKenneth      //
//  Spec helper version   //
///////////////////////////

//These scrips are designed to make simplify and streamline camerawork in competitive 6v6 casting, and to prevent the toggling through classes to find the action in fast paced games.

//This version must have the specbinds plugin enabled to work. It will not work otherwise.

//THIS IS IN ALPHA - I take no resposibility for it messing with any of your configs. However I will try and do the best I can to make sure they don't cause any issues so let me know but don't blame me for accidently killing your first born child. I'd recommend that if there is any keys in here that are bound for specific use somewhere else durring normal play you put those binds in your autoexec.cfg file.

////////
//Use//
//////

//Before use put -insecure into your lauch options to enable the spechelper plugin
//Type in the console "exec specbinds_stv" (without quotes) when you want to load the config
//To assign a class key, hold down that key and then press the corresponding select key
//For example, the red medic is selected by pressing 5 in normal use. Hold down T and then press 5. From now on when you press T it will select the red medic
//Assign all classes using the method above, then have fun.
