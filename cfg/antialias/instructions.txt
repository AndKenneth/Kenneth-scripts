1. Copy and Paste or symlink the antialias folder into your cfg folder. (it will look like cfg/antialias/*all the files and folders*)
	*symlinking will allow a producer to change the definitions via dropbox instead of you having to if something messes up

2. Launch game with statusspec installed (and in -insecure mode) and execute "exec antialias/antialias". I'd recommend assigning this to an alias or a straight exec in your main casting config.

3. It will assign the players defined by definitions and that exist in the team folders to your standard casting aliases.

4. Enjoy antialiased players
